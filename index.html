                <h3>With the coming of the world cup this year illegal gambling acticities are on the rise. People truely love the brief thrill and excitement gambling gives when winning is unsurpassed. Some people gamble just for
                    fun or to socialise with other people, while others do it to try to gain some quick cash. 
                    There are those who feel that gambling acts as a "Stress Reliever" for them too. However, most gamblers prefer to partake
                    in illegal gambling activities instead of legal ones. <br> <br> Why is this so? <br> <br>

                    Firstly, illegal gambling is much more convenient and cheaper for the average person. In most cases, gamblers are able to 
                    gamble in the comfort of their home as they would not need to travel to other places to gamble legally. Additionally, there are almost
                    no restrictions regarding how much they can gamble, and they can save money as they do not have to pay taxes for their winnings. 
                    <br> <br> It may all seem like fun and games at first. However the drawbacks heavliy outweigh the "Positive" aspects. <br> <br>

                <h3>Bankcruptcy is one of the most common effects of gambling. After winning once, your brain craves the feeling of winning
                    over and over again, resulting in you gambling all your life savings away without a second thought. <br> <br>
                    Another major side effect is the potential exposure to harmful substances. When gambling illegaly, people may socialise
                    with "dangerous" people who might offer them substances to keep them high and gamble more. Such substances such as drugs
                    can harm one's body in many ways, destroying one's health. <br> <br>
                    If you were caught by the government, hefty fines of up to $50,000 and jail time of up to 3 years could be charged upon you,
                    according to Singapore's law system. <br> <br>
                    Stress or depression is also another serious side effect of gambling. Similar to smoking, gambling can be a very extremely hard
                    habit to stop which could result in people displaying erractic behaviour or wanting to constantly be alone.
                    This kind of behaviour could lead to thoughts of self harm, such as commiting sucide. <br> <br>
